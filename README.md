# Practice Problem Intel Scene Classification Challenge in Analytics Vidhya

# Problem Statement:
How do we, humans, recognize a forest as a forest or a mountain as a mountain? 
We are very good at categorizing scenes based on the semantic representation and object affinity, but we know very little about the processing and encoding of natural scene categories in the human brain. 
In this practice problem, you are provided with a dataset of ~25k images from a wide range of natural scenes from all around the world. 
Your task is to identify which natural scene can the image be categorized into.

# DATASET DESCRIPTION
There are 17034 images in train and 7301 images in test data.
The categories of natural scenes and their corresponding labels in the dataset are as follows -
{     'buildings' -> 0,     'forest' -> 1,     'glacier' -> 2,     'mountain' -> 3,     'sea' -> 4,     'street' -> 5 } 

 Variable 	              Definition
image_name 	     Name of the image in the dataset (ID column)
label 	         Category of natural scene (target column)
